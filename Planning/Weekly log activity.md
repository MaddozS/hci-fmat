The data collection method was defined, which will be a survey that we will send to the students of the faculty. A draft of questions was created which we will refine to transfer it to a Google Forms and start conducting the survey.
Later we will finish the survey, and we would begin to distribute it to a large number of people and then as a team analyze the results and define our conclusions.

We were working in the first delivery video, with collecting information about our observational research, like our Persona and experiences of our team members. We will start working doing some changes in that data recollected, because we notice may not be relevant for our project, so we will redo our survey, work on an interview with people who organizes communities/projects and hopefully, with the data recollected, refine our persona and initial requirements
