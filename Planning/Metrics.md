# Metrics

The metrics will evaluate the contribution and progress of each member by deliveries, defined by professor Edgar Cambranes.

The metric we choose is using [Story Points](https://help.ducalis.io/knowledge-base/story-points-how-fibonacci-sequence-works-for-agile-estimation/) to weigth te complexity of the tasks, after that, we will sum up all the points of the delivery and get the Individual Contribution Metric of each member by delivery, if multiple member of the team work in the same tasks, we count the task with the same points for each member working on that
