# Opportunity points / Possible solutions / Our strategy

Using the information we have gathered between our interviews with student organizations and the general survey we have conducted with students, we have synthesized three fundamental parts that we must develop if we want to encourage social cohesion among university students:

- The formation of student groups is a great way to encourage participation and cooperation among university students. These groups can be based on common interests, such as sports, art, music, academic activities, volunteering, among others.

- Communication is key to creating healthy social relationships. Therefore, the creation of online discussion groups, chat groups or thematic forums could be promoted. These groups could be based on common interests or specific degrees.

- Interdisciplinary projects could be a great way to foster cooperation between students from different degrees. These projects could be based on current issues or research projects, and could be led by professors or students with more experience.
