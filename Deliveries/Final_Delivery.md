## Usability Testing Plan

Before conducting the usability tests, we had to create a plan to follow. We decided to define an Usability Testing Plan, which is a document that describes the objectives, scope, and methodology of the usability testing process. It helps to guide the testing process and provides a point of reference for evaluating the test results.
You can find the document [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RlMW1gxT0zSXGGcqSxq8IaHzHp68YocDe69JEFOmYqQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## Usability tests design

After defining the plan, we start to design the scenarios for the usability tests. We decided to create two different scenarios, one for students and another one for organizers and community leaders. The scenarios basically are:

- **Scenario 1:** You are a student who wants to participate in a event. You want to know more about the event and register for it.
- **Scenario 2:** You are an student who want to see an specific event. You have to go to the event page, search an specific event and confirm your attendance.
- **Scenario 3:** You are an student who wants to join a group. You have to go to the group group, search for an specific group and join it.
- **Scenario 4:** You are an organizer or community leader who wants to create an event. You have to create an event from the group.
- **Scenario 5:** You are an organizer or community leader who wants to create a new group. You have to create a new group from the group page.

## Usability tests tools

To keep track of the usability tests, we decided to use Maze as our tool. Maze is a user testing platform that turns your prototype into actionable insights from real users, bringing confidence to the design process. It allows you to create a test, invite users to take it and analyze the results.
The test for students can be found [here](https://t.maze.co/163316891?guerilla=true&notrack=true) and the test for organizers and community leaders can be found [here](https://t.maze.co/163071637?guerilla=true&notrack=true).
