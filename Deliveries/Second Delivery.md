# Second Delivery

## Requirements evolution

### Changes on the Requirements

In this delivery, we define with better detail the requirements of our project. We decide to create a Software Requirement Specification document to write all the features and requirements of the system. In our document, we define the main features of the application with a description of their funcionalities, after that, each member of the team defined different use cases that apply to those features.

### Relation between requirements 

In the definition of our Use Case table, the define which Use Cases and which Non functional requirements applies to the system. We have this UC as example:

Also the definition of the Use Cases can imply some usability requirements that are revelant for our project

### Usability Requirements Specification

In our document, we have a specific section that defines the NFR of our system:

### Traceability of requirements

We did not define a specific artifact or document that allow us to map our requirements to the wireframes, however, our prototypes tried to be organized in section that represent at least the main sections defined in our SRS.

You can read more about requirements in our [Software Requirements Specification document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ixKyyl27_yUNarjqch0HmAOMek8bJX1Y/edit#)
