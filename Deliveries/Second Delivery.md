# Second Delivery

## Requirements evolution

### Changes on the Requirements

In this delivery, we define with better detail the requirements of our project. We decide to create a Software Requirement Specification document to write all the features and requirements of the system. In our document, we define the main features of the application with a description of their funcionalities, after that, each member of the team defined different use cases that apply to those features.

### Relation between requirements 

In the definition of our Use Case table, the define which Use Cases and which Non functional requirements applies to the system. We have this UC as example:

Also the definition of the Use Cases can imply some usability requirements that are revelant for our project

### Usability Requirements Specification

An important part for our project is defining the usability requirements as usability is one of the most critical aspects for the user experience.
We defined the nonfunctional requirements, particularly those for usability, so that we can guarantee coherence on the user interface and on the user experience throughout the system.
Likewise these requirements are organized by priority in order to identify the functions that are more important for the user. E.g

### Traceability of requirements

We did not define a specific artifact or document that allow us to map our requirements to the wireframes, however, our prototypes tried to be organized in section that represent at least the main sections defined in our SRS.

You can read more about requirements in our [Software Requirements Specification document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ixKyyl27_yUNarjqch0HmAOMek8bJX1Y/edit#)

## Prototypes

### Prototypes development

For the creation of our prototypes, we opted to employ Figma which allows us to use prototyping libraries to start portraying what was defined in our Requirements Specification document.
Due to the needs of our application, we generated some components to make the system as homogenous as possible.

### Design Guides

The design guides are a set of rules and principles used to ensure that the digital product fulfills with certain design standards. In this case we combined Mobile Wireframer UI Kit and Mobile Wireframing Kit to fulfill base criterias for a mobile platform.

### Prototype Evolution

For the moment, due to being our first prototypes we don’t count with an evolution on the interface design. However, as we made the designs we got small evolutions born from feedback from our teammates, such as the way of using the libraries or improvements to the design standard.


### Interaction Design

Interaction design refers to the process of designing the way users interact with a digital product. In our project, with the interrelation between our use cases and thanks to Figma’s prototyping options, we can portray these interactions between screens and actions.

## Extra: AI designing

As an example on how the AI can provide different result to design systems, we use ChatGPT to create an example of the Main Dashboard with some prompts and comparing it with that we already design:
