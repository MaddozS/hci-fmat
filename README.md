# Itivas

This repository contains the **_artifacts, instruments, documentation and products_** for the HCI 2023 course of the Software Engineering major at UADY, FMAT

## Project Design

We want to implement a User-Centered design, which is an iterative approach to problem solving that focuses on users on every step of a product's design and development. According to Interaction Design Foundation, the UCD steps are understanding context of use, specifying requirements, designing a solution and evaluating the solution against requirements.

## Team organization

The team members are:

- Antonio Armando MartÃ­n Medina
- Axel AdriÃ¡n Anaya GarcÃ­a
- Irving Eduardo Poot Moo
- Steven Chen Zhen
- Raymundo Mora HernÃ¡ndez
- Roberto Carlos Llanes Montero

### We had two sources for planning:

- ðŸ“… [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/MaddozS/projects/1/views/5) Using an Kanban table to organize our individual task
- ðŸ“… [Log in Markdown](Planning/Planning.md) Provides a weekly summary of planned tasks by the team.

Also, we define a Fibonacci Score for each task, the individual contribution for each delivery and scores can be found [here](Planning/Metrics.md)

## Reflective diaries

As required by the profesor, we have to do some reflection about different topics related to HCI. All the reflections done by each member of the team can be found [here](https://github.com/MaddozS/hci-fmat/tree/main/Reflections/).
