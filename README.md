This repository contains the **_artifacts, documentation and products_** for the HCI 2023 course of the Software Engineering major at UADY, FMAT

## Project Design

We want to implement a User-Centered design, which is an iterative approach to problem solving that focuses on users on every step of a product's design and development. According to Interaction Design Foundation, the UCD steps are understanding context of use, specifying requirements, designing a solution and evaluating the solution against requirements.
