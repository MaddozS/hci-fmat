# Itivas

This repository contains the **_artifacts, instruments, documentation and products_** for the HCI 2023 course of the Software Engineering major at UADY, FMAT

## Project Design

We want to implement a User-Centered design, which is an iterative approach to problem solving that focuses on users on every step of a product's design and development. According to Interaction Design Foundation, the UCD steps are understanding context of use, specifying requirements, designing a solution and evaluating the solution against requirements.

## Team organization

The team members are:

- Antonio Armando MartÃ­n Medina
- Axel AdriÃ¡n Anaya GarcÃ­a
- Irving Eduardo Poot Moo
- Steven Chen Zhen
- Raymundo Mora HernÃ¡ndez
- Roberto Carlos Llanes Montero

### We had two sources for planning:

- ðŸ“… [GitHub Projects](https://github.com/users/MaddozS/projects/1/views/5) Using an Kanban table to organize our individual task
- ðŸ“… [Log in Markdown](Planning/Planning.md) Provides a weekly summary of planned tasks by the team.

Also, we define a Fibonacci Score for each task, the individual contribution for each delivery and scores can be found [here](Planning/Metrics.md)
