# Free topic - Evolution of propotyping

Prototyping is a widely used technique in software development to help designers and developers iterate and improve their work before implementation. With the evolution of prototyping tools and techniques, the software development process has changed significantly in recent decades, and there has been a close relationship between these advances and those of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI).

Initially, software prototypes were based on paper drawings and sketches, which allowed designers and developers to iterate quickly and explore different design options. Then, with the popularity of programming languages and operating systems, code-based prototypes were developed that allowed for more realistic and detailed interaction with the software in development. However, these prototypes were costly and time-consuming.

With the advent of graphic design tools and software-based user interfaces (UI) and user interaction (UX), prototyping became easier and faster. Today, there are specialized prototyping tools such as Sketch, Figma, or InVision, which allow designers to create interactive prototypes more easily and quickly than before.

Advances in HCI have also influenced prototyping, as they have allowed designers and developers to focus on creating more satisfying and personalized user experiences. HCI techniques such as user research and user-centered design allow developers and designers to better understand the needs and expectations of end-users and, therefore, create more effective and satisfying prototypes.
