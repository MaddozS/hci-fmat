# ScanningPatterns

The article talks about something very interesting and that we usually don't consciously reflect on, how do we collect information while browsing a webpage? With the help of eye tracking, it presents different situations in which 4 patterns that are commonly used are presented, and we are invited to consider using one of them in our designs to present content.

How? Scanning patterns refer to the way in which users visually scan and navigate a user interface or webpage. By understanding scanning patterns, designers can optimize their UI/prototype layouts to guide the user's attention towards the most important information and actions, this can greatly enhance the overall user experience of a UI/prototype.

At least for our project, we didn't consider it much as we focused more on presenting the information progressively, trying to greatly reduce large amounts of text. But after reading this, I think it would be relevant to give it more thought and implement certain requirements to meet one of the patterns presented in the text.
