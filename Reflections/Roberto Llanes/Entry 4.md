# HCI&UX

HCI and UX are closely related, as HCI focuses on the interaction between humans and computers, while UX focuses on the user's experience during that interaction. In other words, HCI deals with the technical and functional aspects of human-computer interaction, while UX focuses on the emotional and psychological aspects of the user's experience. Both fields aim to design products and systems that are easy to use and provide a positive experience for the user.

One specific difference between HCI and UX is that HCI is more concerned with the technical and functional aspects of human-computer interaction, while UX is more concerned with the emotional and psychological aspects of the user's experience. HCI deals with the design and implementation of interfaces that allow users to interact with computers effectively, while UX is more focused on how the user feels during that interaction, and how that feeling can be improved.

An example of a UX feature that our team's project could include is a feedback mechanism that allows users to rate their experience with the club participation platform. This could be in the form of a simple survey that pops up after the user has completed a task on the platform, such as signing up for a club or attending a club event. This feature would allow our team to gather feedback from users about their experience with the platform, and use that feedback to improve the platform's usability and overall user experience.
