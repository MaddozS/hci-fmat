# Using Personas

The Persona technique has evolved from being a method for IT system development to being applied in a variety of other contexts, including product development, marketing, communication planning, and service design. The persona is commonly understood to be a description of a hypothetical person, and the description is based on assumptions or data.

A persona is different from an archetype or a real person. A persona description is unique in that you do not look at the full person, but rather emphasize the area or domain you are working within to highlight the key attitudes and the specific circumstances associated with the area of work.

In our project, the use of personas help us to understand the type of users that will work in our project, but in specific to design different flows and interactions, for example, a student may join to a group, but only a community leader can create a group.
