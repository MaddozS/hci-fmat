# Borrowed Techniques

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) is a field that focuses on research about how users and computers interact. The field relay on psychology, particularly cognitive psychology, to understand how humans process information and make decisions.

A lot of techniques and methods from that field have been borrowed, one of them being the experiment that have always played an important role in HCI. One of the main experiments used in HCI researches are the usability tests, that aim to measure important differences in the key aspects of usability, including efficiency, effectiveness, and satisfaction. I think other experiments can be applied to understand the human behavior with computers, and lead to a better use of the technology that researchers may or may not visualize.

One advantage of the experiment method in HCI is that it provides a scientific basis for evaluating the usability of interactive systems. By controlling variables in the experiments, researchers can separate the effects of design features on user behavior and performance, allowing for precise evaluation. Also, usability tests provides a way to identify possible usability issues that can affect in the design process, which can save time and resources in the construction process.

However, there are also limitations to the experiment method in HCI, experiments may not always represent the real world, and doing experiments can be time consuming and expensive, which may limit the researchers to perform experiments on a large scale or to do multiple iterations of testing to refine their designs. This may be a key factor for organizations to avoid doing research before implementing new applications or interfaces.
