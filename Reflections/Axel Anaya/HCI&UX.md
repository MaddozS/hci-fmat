# UX & HCI

The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) defines user experience (UX) as "A person's perceptions and responses that result from the use or anticipated use of a product, system, or service." According to Ditte, a representative of the Interaction Design Foundation, UX was previously referred to as Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) during the 1970s, and its importance increased as personal computers became mainstream.

Alan Dix, another expert in the Interaction Design Foundation, describes HCI as a multidisciplinary field of study that focuses on the design of computer technology and the interaction between humans (users) and computers. From the above definitions, we can conclude that both concepts aim to study and comprehend how humans interact with computer systems.

As programmers, we utilize different techniques and tools to design interfaces, such as wireframes, which enable us to discuss ideas with team members and clients and assist designers and developers in their work before moving on to high-fidelity, pixel-perfect deliverables.
Although HCI and UX are related, they differ significantly in their approach. HCI concentrates on the design and evaluation of interfaces based on established principles and guidelines. On the other hand, UX takes a more holistic approach, considering all aspects of the user's interaction with the product, including emotions, perceptions, and attitudes. In other words, HCI is more concerned with the usability of the product, while UX is concerned with the overall experience.

Additionally, Peter Morville defines seven fundamental principles of UX design: useful, usable, desirable, valuable, findable, accessible, and credible. While we aim to implement all these principles in our project, I would like to highlight the usefulness of our project. It has the potential to assist some individuals in their daily lives.
