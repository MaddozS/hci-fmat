# UI vs UX

Although the terms UI (User Interface) and UX (User Experience) are frequently used interchangeably, they actually refer to two distinct design-related concepts. Despite both are necessary for producing a successful good or service, they require various abilities and strategies.

The design of interactions that the users will have with a product or service is called UX design. This consist of everything from the user's initial perception of the product, how easily they can execute their activities and their emotional reaction to the experience. Understanding user requirements and motivations, developing user personas to reflect various user types, providing processes and user interfaces that satisfy those needs are the tasks of UX designers.

The controls, buttons, and other technical components that allow the user to engage with a web page, app or system are known as user interfaces. A meaningful and engaging engagement with your user is provided by the UX aspects that are graphically represented by the UI

With these concepts defined, in our project we tried to implement both of them, first with the UI providing different components that allow the user interact with the application, for example we implement Card Layouts to show differnt information about groups and events, these cards are interactive and allow the user to click on them and see more information about the group or event. We also implemented a navigation bar that allows the user to navigate through the application and see different pages.

For UX, we tried to make our application Content-Focus, with listing and group content and making the information of the system part of the design of the application. We also tried to make the application simple and intuitive, with the minimal amount of steps to complete a task.
