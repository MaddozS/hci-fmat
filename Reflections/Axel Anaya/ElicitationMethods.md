# Elicitation in HCI

Understanding the needs and requirements of stakeholders is a vital step in the elicitation process, which is used to gather data. In order to gather user information, it is a crucial strategy used in software engineering and human-computer interface (HCI). It is advised to work together with people with a range of skills during the system development phase to better grasp difficult problems.

Surveys are one of the most often utilized elicitation methods in HCI. These polls are helpful for tracking changes in user perceptions, awareness, intent, feedback, and other pertinent data over time. We performed a survey with our coworkers as part of our endeavor to collect data.

However, surveys only provide us with the "what," not the "how." This is because they typically provide quantitative data, which may be biased due to the survey's limited number of questions. As a result, it is simple to miss out on relevant data even though it is simple to implement. We collected data for our project about the identities of our primary users, but we didn't record any information about our problems, or even whether our users were impacted by them. This could have been improved by simply asking questions that were more pertinent to our problem than to the needs of the project's users.
