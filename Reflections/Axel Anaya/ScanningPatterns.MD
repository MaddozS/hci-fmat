# Scanning Patterns

In their article _Text Scanning Patterns: Eyetracking Evidence_, Jakob Nielsen and Kara Pernice researches about how people scan information on web pages and how this affects their comprehension about the topic of the page. The authors conducted an eyetracking study to determine how people read web pages and found that users tend to scan the text in four different ways, depending on the type of content they are looking for. They also found that users who scanned text in a certain way were more likely to remember what they read than those who did not scan text in that way.

The study has important implications for web designers who want to create more effective web pages. By formatting text in a way that makes it easy to scan, designers can increase the retention of users that will read the content on their pages. For example, designers can use short paragraphs, bullet points, and subheadings to break up long blocks of text and make it easier for users to find the information they need.

In our project, we do not have any of those pattern considered, at least in a concious way, however, looking again in our prototypes we kind of notice how these patterns appear, for example of the spotted pattern, however, we notice that having consider pattern since the beginning of the project would have been a good idea, since it would have helped us to make a possible better design.
