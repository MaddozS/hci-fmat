# UI Design Patterns

User interface (UI) design patterns are reusable/recurring components which designers use to solve common problems in user interface design. When design a web page or application, the use of design patterns is a good practice, you can reduce the time of design a new UI, and you can provide to your UI commonly used components, allowing a better user experience.

The most common we have are:

- Breadcrumbs: Use linked labels to offer navigation from the front page to one of the following pages in the hierarchy.
- Lazy Registration: Allows unregistered users to sample what the site has for free or familiarize themselves with before showing them the form to register an account or sign in.
- Forgiving Format: Allows the user to input data in various formats.
- Clear Primary Actions: Make buttons stand out for the user to know what to do.
- Progressive Disclosure: Shows the user only the features relevant for the task at hand, one per screen.
- Hover Controls: Hides non-essential information to facilitate the user in finding the relevant information.
- Steps Left: Shows the user how many steps they need to take to complete a task.
- Subscription Plans: Offer users an option menu for joining at certain rates.
- Leaderboard: Ideal in social media to boost engagement.
- Dark Patterns: Lead or trick users into performing certain actions, often to spend more money or surrender personal information. Must be used carefully and ethically to avoid problems

In our project, the use of Clear Primary Actions is one of the most important, because we want to provide a clear feedback to the user, as our NFR mentions "The application must show the actions that the users can use in an intuitive way to avoid confusions."
