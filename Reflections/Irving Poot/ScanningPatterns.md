# ScanningPatterns
The four scanning patterns: F-pattern, spotted pattern, layer-cake pattern, and commitment pattern can be reflected in our team project.

### F-pattern:
When designing the layout of the platform, the most important information such as creating an event, searching for events or registering for events should be placed at the top and left-hand side of the page. This will enable users to quickly and easily find the most important functions and features of the platform.

### Spotted pattern:
When users are searching for specific events, the platform could use a search bar that allows users to enter keywords, which will return a list of relevant events. This will enable users to quickly locate the event they are interested in and skip past irrelevant information.

### Layer-cake pattern:
The layer-cake pattern can be applied to the organization of events on the platform. For example, users can sort events by category, date, or location, creating layers that can be easily navigated.

### Commitment pattern:
When users are creating an event, the platform could use a step-by-step form that guides users through the process of creating an event, ensuring that all the necessary information is captured. This will encourage users to invest time in creating their event and ensure that the event is properly organized.

### Is it relevant to consider a specific scanning pattern for your IU /prototype based on your Non-Functional Requirements of usability?

It is relevant to consider a specific scanning pattern for our UI/prototype based on our non-functional requirements of usability. Non-functional requirements such as usability are critical for the success of a software system, as they determine how well the system can be used and how easy it is to learn and operate.

Understanding the scanning patterns that users employ when interacting with a software system is important because it allows designers to optimize the layout and presentation of information, making it easier for users to find what they need. By taking into account these patterns, designers can create UI/prototypes that are more intuitive, user-friendly, and efficient.
