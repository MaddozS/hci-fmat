# Using Personas
One of the personas that we create is Natalia is interested in attending events with her friends but has limited time and often has to multitask while using the platform.

Based on this persona, the team identified the following needs:

The platform should be easy to use and navigate quickly, as Natalia has limited time to search for events.
The platform should allow Natalia to filter events by date, location, and age range, as these are key factors for her when deciding whether to attend an event.
The platform should provide clear and concise information about each event, as Natalia does not have the time or patience to read lengthy descriptions.
To implement these needs on the UI/prototype, the team made the following design decisions:

- They placed the search bar prominently on the homepage, allowing Natalia to quickly enter search terms and find relevant events.
- They created a filter feature that allows users to sort events by date, location, and age range, making it easy for Natalia to narrow down her options.
- They designed the event cards to display key information (such as date, location, and age range) prominently, with a brief summary of the event below, ensuring that Natalia can quickly scan and identify events that match her criteria.
By considering Natalia's needs and designing the UI/prototype with her persona in mind, the team created a user-friendly and efficient platform that is optimized for busy parents like Natalia. This not only improves the usability of the platform for her, but also helps attract and retain similar users who may have similar needs and priorities.
