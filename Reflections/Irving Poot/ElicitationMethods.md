##_Interviewing:_
Some of the considerations of the interviewing technique are:
- Participant selection
- Question design
- Interview preparation
- Note taking
- Data analysis

In our project the interviews were implemented for the knowledge of our population, for which we contacted experts in the field to give us a closer idea of what we wanted to discover, on this occasion, the interviewees were:
- Daniel _(Líder de eventos en WorkShop)_
- Gilmer _(Líder de contenido en WorkShop)_
- Mariam _(Presidenta de WorkSHop)_
- Noemi _(Presidenta de SA)_
- Sharon Escobar

Our members conducted each of the interviews separately and we analyzed the results by cataloging them according to the "findings" found in their responses.
Personally I feel that the interviews were well conducted, although something we could improve would be the organization, since at the beginning it was a little chaotic, and at the time of taking notes, since the way we did it was a little complicated to perform the analysis quickly, as well as a little practice when finding "findings", since it took us quite a long time to find them.
