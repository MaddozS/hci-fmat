#HCI & UX
HCI and UX are closely related disciplines that are both concerned with designing and improving the interaction between people and technology. HCI is a broader field that encompasses a range of disciplines, including psychology, computer science, engineering, and design. UX, on the other hand, is a more focused field that is concerned specifically with how users interact with products and services.

One specific difference between HCI and UX is that while HCI is concerned with the broader design of interactive systems and technologies, UX is focused specifically on designing products and services that provide a positive user experience. UX designers use a variety of methods and techniques to understand user needs and preferences, and to design products and services that are intuitive, easy to use, and enjoyable to interact with. This often involves user research, prototyping, and usability testing, as well as close collaboration with developers, designers, and other stakeholders.

Another important distinction between HCI and UX is that while HCI is a more established and academic field, UX has emerged more recently as a result of the growing importance of user-centered design in product development. As a result, UX has a more practical and applied focus, and is often integrated more closely with product development processes than HCI.

Despite these differences, HCI and UX are closely related fields that share many common goals and methods. Both are concerned with designing and improving the interaction between people and technology, and both rely on a range of user-centered design methods and techniques to achieve these goals. By working together, HCI and UX practitioners can create products and services that are both effective and enjoyable to use, and that meet the needs and preferences of users.
